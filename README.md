# Task

## About the project
A task is a job to be done that is requested by a service provider. A task can be a delivery, service, meet up with a customer or service provider. Each task is paired with a Constraint/Stage configuration. 

These Constraint/Stage's can modify the task's properties (e.g A customer can edit or add new properties to a product they want to buy through a constraint) or they can be used to provide new experiences to the customer (This could be in the form of a Delivery info constraint, Map constraint, Chat constraint etc. Each of these can be run by a customer if they want to)

There are 2 types of tasks: **Product** and **Service** tasks.
